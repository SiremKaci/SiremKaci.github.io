Hi, I’m a Data Scientist
 About Me

I am a junior Data Scientist passionate about transforming real-world data into meaningful insights and practical solutions.
I work on end-to-end data science projects covering data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation and interpretation.

My interests include applied Machine Learning, Deep Learning, time-series analysis, recommender systems and anomaly detection, with applications in security, healthcare, e-commerce and industry.

I focus on building realistic, well-documented and interpretable models, while clearly discussing assumptions and limitations.
